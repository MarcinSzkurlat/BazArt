### BazArt is an app that combines the concept of a bazaar with art. In this app, artists will be able to showcase and sell their work, create events, and more. The application will be developed using C# and ASP.NET Core, employing Clean Architecture and CQRS with MediatR. Microsoft SQL Server will be used as the database, while the frontend will be developed in React with TypeScript
